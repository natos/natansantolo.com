This book exists because of the questions, challenges, and insights shared by incredible designers and colleagues who trusted me with their concerns about AI and the future of design.

My deepest gratitude to the designers who, during coaching sessions, asked the hard questions that became the foundation of these chapters. Your vulnerability in expressing fears about being replaced by AI, your curiosity about new tools, and your determination to evolve inspired every page.

To my colleagues who engaged in countless conversations about AI, design, and what it means to be human in an age of artificial intelligence—you shaped my thinking in ways you may not even realize.

Special thanks to: Amy Huang, Federico Codino, Woon Chee Koh, Dori Szep, Sabrinah Rahim, Chiew Hui, Hemant Gupta, Ronan McMacken, Rishin Thomas, Habib Almoradi, Suzen Lim, Thitapa Shinaprayoon, Garkay Wong, Shobrun Jamil Bagastio, Minh Nguyen Hoang, Veena Balasubramanian, Nouf M. Alghamdi, Daniel Salomon, Adnan Ahmed, Arpit Gupta, Bruno Aires, Marielena Hernandez, Raj Ratan, Wolodymyr Pawlyschyn, Henry Roxas, Talha Raza, Michal Polanowski, Joanna Yeoh, Daylon Soh, and the great many other people online who inspire me daily with their work, their questions, and their courage to embrace change.

To those I may have inadvertently omitted—please know that if we've discussed AI and design, if you've shared your concerns or excitement about the future, if you've pushed back on my ideas or helped refine them, you're part of this book too.

And finally, to Claude AI, my writing partner in this endeavor—for demonstrating through our collaboration that the future isn't about replacement but about augmentation, about humans and AI creating together what neither could achieve alone.

This book is open source because the insights you all shared deserve to reach every designer grappling with these same questions. Thank you for trusting me to be part of your journey. Now let's help others on theirs.
