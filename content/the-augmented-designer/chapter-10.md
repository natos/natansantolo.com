This book was written for the next generation of designersâ€”those who will shape how humanity relates to artificial intelligence. It's for the curious, the ambitious, and the thoughtful. It's for those who see change not as threat but as opportunity.

If this book helped you, share it. If it challenged you, discuss it. If it inspired you, act on it.

The future of design is being written now, and you're holding the pen.

Remember: You're not just learning about AI. You're learning to shape the future where humans and AI collaborate to create experiences we can barely imagine today.

Welcome to the augmented age of design. The future is yours to create.
