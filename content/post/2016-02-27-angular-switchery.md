[Alexander](https://github.com/abpetkov) built this beautiful checkbox component called [Switchery](http://abpetkov.github.io/switchery/). From their website: "Switchery is a simple component that helps you turn your default HTML checkbox inputs into beautiful iOS 7 style switches in just few simple steps. You can easily customize switches, so that they match your design perfectly."

I've used it along different projects, I'm really happy with it. But when I tried to included in a project using AngularJS, I found a few challenges. Although there are a few directives around (like [NgSwitchery](https://github.com/servergrove/NgSwitchery)), I couldn't find one with support for two-way binding, I needed to keep my models updated. So I went for it and built a new directive.

Here's [Angular Switchery](http://natos.github.io/angular-switchery/), [a directive](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive) that transform a simple checkbox into a switch, and supports two way bindings to scope variables, to keep view and data in sync. You'll find the code and install instructions in [Github](https://github.com/natos/angular-switchery).

Run this JSFiddle to see it working or [check the demo](http://natos.github.io/angular-switchery/)
