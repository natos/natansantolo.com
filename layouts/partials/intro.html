<section class="intro">
  I coach people on startups, ux, product and design in <a target="_blank" href="https://adplist.org/mentors/natan-santolo">ADPList.</a> 
  Inpired in my learnings as a a coach I wrote a book: <a href="/the-augmented-designer">The Augmented Designer</a> for designers to understand how AI can amplify their careers.
  I think is our responsability as designers to create what we wish existed, so I made this <a href="#arcade">game of snake</a> that you can play with the arrow keys. Enjoy!
