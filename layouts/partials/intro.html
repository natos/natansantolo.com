    I advocate for <strong>responsible</strong>,
    <strong>purpose-driven</strong>, <strong>human-centered design</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is my belief that the practice of <strong>good design</strong> can create
    a better, more inclusive, and sustainable world. I trust that with the right
    strategies in place, <strong>design practice</strong> can elevate companies
    to be in sync with people and the environment creating a great deal of value
    for all.
