<section class="intro">
  <p>In the last decade, I've led design teams and shaped products across global markets. My work sits at the intersection of user research, product strategy, and organizational change, helping companies make better decisions faster by actually understanding their users.</p>
  <p>I'm especially interested in how design and AI can work together without the hype. That's why I wrote <a href="/the-augmented-designer">The Augmented Designer</a>, a book for designers who want to understand how <strong>AI can amplify their work</strong>, not replace it.</p>
  <p>I think is our responsability as designers to create what we wish existed, so I made this <a href="#arcade">game of snake</a> that you can play with the arrow keys. Enjoy!</p>

  <p>By the way, I coach people on startups, ux, product and design in <a target="_blank" href="https://adplist.org/mentors/natan-santolo">ADPList.</a> Get in touch.</p>
