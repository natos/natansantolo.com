<section class="about">
  <p>In the last decade, I've led design teams and shaped products across global markets. My work sits at the intersection of user research, product strategy, and organizational change, helping companies make better decisions faster by actually understanding their users.</p>

  <p>I'm especially interested in how design and AI can work together without the hype. That's why I wrote <a href="/the-augmented-designer">The Augmented Designer</a>, a book for designers who want to understand how <strong>AI can amplify their work</strong>, not replace it.</p>

  <p>These days, I split my time between:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Coaching designers and founders on <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/natan-santolo">ADPList</a></li>
    <li>Writing about design, AI, and the future of creative work</li>
    <li>Working with teams to build better products</li>
  </ul>
