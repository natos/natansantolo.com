    <h2>Hi there!</h2>
    <p>Nice to meet you, my name is Natan Santolo. I'm the founder of <a href="http://www.three-leaves.com" target="_blank">Three Leaves</a> and CTO of <a href="http://scalable.business" target="_blank">Scalabl</a>. Currently I'm collaborating with <a href="http://www.spaaza.com" target="_blank">Spaaza</a> in some of their projects, and also helping the amazing <strong>Marcela Viola</strong> with <a href="http://www.marcelaviola.com.ar" target="_blank">her website</a> and <a href="http://medium.com/@marcelaviola" target="_blank">her blogging</a>. Before that, I co-founded <a href="http://www.caliber.io" target="_blank">Caliber</a> and <a href="http://www.tiplinks.com" target="_blank">Tiplinks</a>, and way before I created <a href="http://chico-ui.com.ar" target="_blank">Chico UI</a> open source project for <a href="http://www.mercadolibre.com" target="_blank">MercadoLibre</a>.
    <p>I've built websites and apps for fun and profit since 1998. Nowadays I'm quite enthusiastic with technology and its fast growth. I feel I'm still fascinated like the first day.</p>
    <p>Here you'll find some thoughts I like to share about building web products.</p>
