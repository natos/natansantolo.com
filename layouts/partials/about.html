  <h2>Hi there!</h2>
  <p>Nice to meet you, my name is Natan Santolo. I've been designing and building websites and apps for fun and profit since 1998. And I'm still fascinated like the first day.

  <p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/natos" target="_blank">occasionally tweet</a> about <em>user experience</em>, <em>web development</em> and other boring stuff. When I have spare time, I like to collaborate <a href="https://github.com/natos" target="_blank">coding in different projects</a> specially <em>html</em>, <em>css</em> and <em>javascript</em>. To get out of my confort zone I speak at conferences, I like it, but I still have a lot to learn. I also enjoy <a href="http://natos.tumblr.com/">writing nonsenses</a> in a little blog and I like to <a href="http://aboxfullofsounds.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">collect and share music</a>.

  <p>Currently I'm in Singapore, working at <a href="http://www.lazada.com" target="_blank"><strong>Lazada</strong></a> exploring the challenging landscape of <em>ecommerce</em> in Southeast Asia. I'm also collaborating as <em>Innovation Advisor</em> at <a href="http://scalable.business" target="_blank"><strong>Scalabl</strong></a> in Latin America.

  <p>Before coming to the east, I lived in Amsterdam where I worked at <a href="http://www.spaaza.com" target="_blank"><strong>Spaaza</strong></a> to improve the <em>user experience</em> for their <a href="http://www.spaaza.com" target="_blank"><em>platform</em></a> and at <a href="http://hackyourfuture.net" target="_blank"><strong>HackYourFuture</strong></a> as Mentor for <strong>refugees</strong> students on how to prepare for the first <em>software developer</em> job. Also worked for <a href="http://www.libertyglobal.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Liberty Global</strong></a>, the largest international cable company, I designed and built interesting <em>web applications</em> for <em>mobiles</em>, <em>tablets</em>, <em>tv</em> and <em>desktop browsers</em>.

  <p>Before Europe, I briefly lived in New York, I <em>co-founded</em> first <strong>Tiplinks</strong> and then <a href="https://angel.co/caliber" target="_blank"><strong>Caliber</strong></a>. <span title="A long time ago in a galaxy far far away">Way way before</span> in Buenos Aires, I <em>created</em> <a href="http://chico.mercadolibre.com" target="_blank"><strong>Chico UI</strong></a> for <a href="http://www.mercadolibre.com" target="_blank"><strong>MercadoLibre</strong></a>, I <em>taught web development</em> in <a href="https://www.davinci.edu.ar/" target="_blank"><strong>Escuela Da Vinci</strong></a> and founded the first <em>user experience team</em> in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/cubika" target="=_blank"><strong>Cubika</strong></a>. But my first gig, was as <a href="https://www.behance.net/natansantolo" target="_blank"><em>graphic designer</em></a> at <a href="http://arredo.com.ar/"><strong>Arredo</strong></a>.
