<section class="about">
  <p>I've been <a href="https://www.behance.net/natansan" target="_blank">designing and building websites and apps</a> for fun and profit since 1998 and I'm still fascinated like the first day. I <a href="https://twitter.com/natos" target="_blank">occasionally tweet</a> about <strong>Design</strong>, <strong>User Experience</strong>, <strong>Web Development</strong>, and other related stuff. 
    <!-- When I have spare time, I like to collaborate <a href="https://github.com/natos" target="_blank">coding in different projects</a> specially <em>html</em>, <em>css</em> and <em>javascript</em>.  -->
    <!-- I also enjoy <a href="http://natos.tumblr.com" target="_blank">writing nonsenses</a> and <a href="http://aboxfullofsounds.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">collecting music</a> in my Tumblr blogs. -->
    
    <p>Currently, I'm in Singapore working at <a href="http://www.airasia.com"><strong>AirAsia</strong></a> as Head of Product Design, leading the <strong>User Experience Team</strong> for the digital products. The travel industry is fascinating and I'm learning a lot about its unique challenges, we are using <strong>Service Design</strong> methodologies to uncover unseen opportunities for <em>enhancing revenue performance</em>, <em>reduce costs</em> and find innovations that will help different teams to provide a better services. Before <a href="http://www.airasia.com"><strong>AirAsia</strong></a>, I worked at <a href="http://www.lazada.com" target="_blank"><strong>Lazada (Alibaba)</strong></a> exploring the challenging landscape of <em>e-commerce</em> in Southeast Asia. Here, I manage the <strong>Service and Product Innovation Experience Design</strong> division within the <strong>User Experience Design Team</strong>.</p>
    <p>Out of the office, I speak at conferences and I run a little <em>design community</em> that we call <strong><a href="https://natansantolo.typeform.com/to/OpG5zy" target="_blank">User Experience Design Club</a></strong> where I mentor young designers into our profession. Although I'm based in Singapore, I'm still connected to the international scene through my role as <em>Innovation Advisor</em> at <a href="http://scalable.business" target="_blank"><strong>Scalabl</strong></a>.</p>
    <p>Before coming to the east, I lived in Amsterdam where I worked at <a href="http://www.spaaza.com" target="_blank"><strong>Spaaza</strong></a> to improve the <em>user experience</em> for their <a href="http://www.spaaza.com" target="_blank"><em>platform</em></a> and at <a href="http://hackyourfuture.net" target="_blank"><strong>HackYourFuture</strong></a> as Mentor for <strong>refugees</strong> to prepare them for the first job in the <em>tech industry</em>. Also worked for <a href="http://www.libertyglobal.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Liberty Global</strong></a> where I designed and built interesting <em>web applications</em> for <em>mobiles</em>, <em>tablets</em>, <em>tv</em> and <em>desktop browsers</em>. Europe was a great experience for me, I made a lot of good friends, I learnt a lot and I got to travel everywhere.

  <p>Before Europe, I briefly lived in New York, I <em>co-founded</em> first <strong>Tiplinks</strong> and then <a href="https://angel.co/caliber" target="_blank"><strong>Caliber</strong></a> (now <a href="https://www.fetcher.ai" target="_blank">Fetcher</a>). <span title="A long time ago in a galaxy far far away">Way, way before</span> in Buenos Aires, I worked for <a href="http://www.mercadolibre.com" target="_blank"><strong>MercadoLibre</strong></a> the massive e-commerce of LATAM where I <em>created</em> <a href="http://chico.mercadolibre.com" target="_blank"><strong>Chico UI</strong></a>, I <em>taught design and web development</em> in <a href="https://www.davinci.edu.ar/" target="_blank"><strong>Escuela Da Vinci</strong></a> and founded the first <em>User Experience Team</em> in <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cubika" target="=_blank"><strong>Cubika</strong></a> (acquired by <a href="https://www.globallogic.com" target="_blank">GlobalLogic</a>). But my first gig was at <a href="http://arredo.com.ar/" target="_blank"><strong>Arredo</strong> as a <a href="https://www.behance.net/natansantolo" target="_blank"><em>graphic designer</em></a></a>.
